## Installation

To install the app, the user will need to add three JSON packages.
``bash
console.table
inquirer
mysql
``

Once these have been installed, the user is ready to start the app! Simply open the index.js file in the terminal, then write node index.js and the user will be prompted questions to begin.

## Usage

Once the app has been initialized, the user can select any of the following selections to start. Users can add departments, roles, and employees, update an employee role, view departments, roles, and employees, or end the app.

If the user selects an option to add a department, role, or employee, they will be prompted a series of questions to do so. Once this has been done, the information is stored in the MySQL database to be used later.

The user is able to change the role ID of any given employee so that the employee's information can be accurately reflected in their database.

The user at any point can view the data they have added to their database. They can view each table individually or they can see them all at once. Once they are finished adding the information they want, they can then end the app by selecting 'All Done!'.
